# Requirements
- ✅ Must use latest version of Language/Framework of choice
- ✅ Must use CSS/SCSS to style component (use of a CSS framework is allowed and encouraged)
- I decided on using a set of simple Ant Design components that provide basic styling.
- ✅ Project should contain linting config
- As a user I should be able to search for a pokemon
- As a user I should be able to filter type
- As a user I should be able to sort by name, type
- As a user I would like to be able to favorite a number of pokemon and I would like those pokemon to persist in the browser (local is sufficient, no need for external APIs)
- ✅ My favorites should be accessible on a different route
- ✅ Use this API https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox
I was the most unfamiliar with graphQL and this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKFoAF7J0mc) helped me understand how to get the data using apollo and setup graphql with a new React project.
- ✅ The URL for the graphql api is: https://dex-server.herokuapp.com/
# Nice to haves
- Unit tests
- ✅ Show pokemon picture
Using the query system from the graphql docs, I deduced that the best photo to use was 
- Multi user (local) system
- Custom styling
- ✅ A favicon
